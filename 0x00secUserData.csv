1,[19087],[73443],sp1der7,[30127],Does anyone here believe that a future cyberpunk world will be possible in maybe a 100 Years or more. I’m referring to the world as being very highly technologically advanced in most or almost every country. Some countries already are at a very high technological stage such as China for example. Let me guys know what you think.,"Jul 9, 2022 2:41 pm"
2,[19149],[73451],fugna,[30127],"Just a personal opinion. To live in a high-tech era, we should before live in a scientific era. 100 years ago we didn’t live in a scientific era, 50 years later neither. And today there are high discrepancies between social and cultural level of education. We don’t live in a scientific era too, and most people needed to make a complex infrastructure efficient and functional  don’t have the information needed. So I don’t believe something like this will be possible so soon, and if someone will try to build it, the only effect possible will be a dystopia, and will become decadent in a matter of years.","Jul 10, 2022 6:05 am"
3,[18593],[73517],Kedislav,[30127],"I think we, as the regular population, are sufficiently technologically advanced; it just so happens that people don’t really understand the nitty gritty details of the tech they use daily. On the other hand, I do believe that automation in the field of warfare and the like will continue advancing, and at the rate the economy is plummeting and how the 1% is becoming richer and richer, revolution has to come sooner or later. Society as a whole is at stake, considering the consequences of climate change, and despots rising to power and being maintained there by lobbying and/or misinformation campaigns. The cyberpunk future in my opinion is already here, has been since the internet left its ARPANET cage and grew into this super-monstrosity, and it has continued to get worse with the Silicon Valley giants owning most of the internet services. Privacy rights have been constantly undermined and exploited by governmental and private interests alike.","Jul 11, 2022 4:49 pm"

7,[19413],[73964],Mitch_Krendall,[30127],"No. Within 100 years human society will wipe itself out. That or it will regress towards a non-technological, primitive framework akin to at least that of the pre-industrial revolution.","Jul 30, 2022 6:12 pm"

21,[19125],[73351],cpp_user,[29020],"As a POC malware developer, I can’t say Python is good. If you want high performance, an important part in malware, you have to learn a compiled language. I would recommend C/C++ or Go. Go is good for desktop and server malware, C/C++ for all places because it is cross platform. Python is not cross platform, so it is not good. Speaking from experience. Earlier, malware devs would use Python, but the problem was when compiling for Windows using py2exe, it would leave a lot of metadata used to identify them. So, they switched to Go. Go is easier to learn than Python, is powerful as C++/C, and is compiled, fast as well, and is high level. Go generated executables are big, so pack them with UPX. C++/C are low level languages and are more cross platform than Go, so what I did was learn C++ and Go. C++ and C can be used together, Go can be used with C, but not C++. So, what you should do is learn a low level language and a high level language. Also, Go is the easiest programming language in existence currently, so making malware will be easy in Go and it can replace C/C++ sometimes, but for mobile malware, you should use C/C++.","Jul 6, 2022 9:46 am"
22,[19125],[73352],cpp_user,[29020],"Go runs on UNIX and its variants (MacOS, Linux, BSD,) and Windows, C++ on all platforms in existence currently.","Jul 6, 2022 9:47 am"
23,[19170],[73461],C12H4Cl2F6N4OS,[29020],"Considering most malware uses OS specific APIs when writing malware in C/C++, means the code is not cross platform at all…","Jul 10, 2022 1:43 pm"
24,[19218],[73878],nightwolf,[29020],"It depends, for example, you could take a look at Sliver a C2 framework written in Go. There are things  that are OS specific but a base implant can be generated for just about anything Go can compile to in theory.  Really, a lot of language choice boils down to personal preference and the challenges you want to deal with.","Jul 27, 2022 8:21 am"
